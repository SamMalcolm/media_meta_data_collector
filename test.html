 immoral party girl, and Deanie who will do anything to hold onto Bud regardless of the consequences. They also face
 pressures from their parents who have their own expectation for their offspring. Bud's overbearing father, Ace Stamper,

 GB<br />Runtime: 1hr 46 min<br /><br />New Yorkers Paul Bratter and Corie Bratter née Banks have just gotten married.
 He is a stuffed shirt just starting his career as a lawyer. She is an independently minded free spirit who prides
 herself on doing the illogical purely out of a sense of adventure, such acts as walking through Washington Square Park
 barefoot when it's 17°F outside. Their six day honeymoon at the Plaza Hotel shows that they can get to know each other
 easily in the biblical sense. But they will see if they can get to know each other in their real life when they move
 into their first apartment, a cozy (in other words, small), slightly broken down top floor unit in a five story
 walk-up. While Corie joyfully bounds up and down the stairs, Paul, always winded after the fact, hates the fact of
 having to walk up the six flights of stairs, if one includes the stairs that comprise the outside front stoop. Beyond
 the issues with the apartment itself, Paul and Corie will have to deal with an odd assortment of neighbors...

 brought some crazy tech with him, including a translation device that lets them talk for the first time. Unfortunately
 for the intergalactic Scaldronian empire, but fortunately for the jungle, Fneep is a terrible conqueror: He's homesick,
 he's crashed his ship, and he's no match for the antics of MUNKI, TRUNK and the gang. Our heroes won't let a little
 alien conquest get in the way of a good time or a new friend. As the animals help him on his journey home, he learns
 that friendship could be the greatest force in the universe. But is it a match for a spaceship full of aliens?

 of seventeen years has just left her for a girl he met while buying a shirt in Bloomingdale's. This movie shows Erica
 coming to terms with the break-up, while revising her opinions of herself, redefining that self in its own right rather
 than as an extension of somebody else's personality, and finally going out with another man. Erica refuses to drop
 everything for Saul, an abstract expressionist painter, simply out of love for him, because he expects her to. It is
 not so much loneliness that is her problem, and the problems that men, flitting around this newly "available" woman
 like moths round a flame, bring to her sense of independence. https://yts.mx/movies/an-unmarried-woman-1978
